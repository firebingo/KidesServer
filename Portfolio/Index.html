		<h3><strong><a href="https://github.com/firebingo/Cubed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cubed/Shape Switch</a>:</strong></h3>
		<iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-nYVfAULHA" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		<br />
		Cubed started as a 3d 3rd person level based platformer where the player was a Cube. Turned out Cubes don't work well for precision platforming so the game was turned into a puzzle platformer called Shape Switch. The player can be either a sphere or cube and has the ability to switch between the different shapes placed on the map. Shapes can also absorb each other and gain the ability to switch in place. Each shape has it's unique advantages to navigating the levels. Project currently only has 1 test level with 4 shapes that takes about 10 minutes to complete. Two levels from the Cubed days also exist in the project but are not guaranteed to run properly. Features a basic main menu and pause menu with options to restart, modify control sensitivity, and graphics options with live modification. Has auto and manual camera controls with collision detection.
